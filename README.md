# AppFramework

An application framework to be used in conjunction with [SwiftFrameGraph](https://github.com/troughton/SwiftFrameGraph). It currently supports two windowing systems: a native Cocoa-based implementation for macOS, and an SDL-based implementation for other platforms. All platforms use SDL for gamepad support, when present.

[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/ImGui) is integrated for the GUI framework.

Example applications will come in the not-too-distant future!
